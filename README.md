# Enhancing-Contrastive-Learning-for-DR-Grading
##Overview
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of blindness globally, poses significant diagnostic challenges. The SCL-SEM (Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning through Saliency Estimation Map) framework represents an innovative approach in the grading of DR, leveraging the power of deep learning to improve early detection and accurate grading. Our method integrates semi-supervised learning with contrastive learning, enhanced by a saliency estimation map, to address the scarcity of annotated medical images and the complexity of DR lesions and fundus physiological structures. This project aims to facilitate the development of efficient and reliable automated systems for DR grading, contributing significantly to the prevention of blindness caused by diabetic retinopathy.


##Datasets and Results
The framework has been extensively validated on publicly available diabetic retinopathy grading datasets, such as EyePACS and Messidor, showcasing superior performance over existing methods. Detailed results and comparative analyses are provided to illustrate the advancements achieved by our model.


##Contribute
We welcome contributions from the community to further enhance the SCL-SEM framework. Whether you are looking to fix bugs, improve the code, or extend the model's capabilities, please feel free to fork the repository and submit your pull requests. For any questions or suggestions, open an issue on the GitHub page, and we'll be happy to discuss them.

Join us in advancing the field of medical imaging and making a tangible impact on the fight against diabetic retinopathy.
