# Enhancing-Contrastive-Learning-for-DR-Grading
## Overview

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide, posing significant challenges in diagnosis. The SCL-SEM framework, which stands for semi-supervised contrastive learning through saliency estimation maps, represents an innovative approach to DR grading. It leverages the power of deep learning to enhance early detection and accurate grading. Our method combines semi-supervised learning and contrastive learning, augmented with saliency estimation maps, to address the scarcity of annotated medical images and the complexity of DR lesions and the retinal physiological structure. This project aims to promote the development of efficient and reliable automated systems for DR grading, making a significant contribution to preventing blindness caused by diabetic retinopathy.


## Noting
Due to the regulations of our research group and the relevance to our ongoing work, only a portion of the core code of this project is made available as open source. We hope this approach ensures the smooth progress of our related work and appreciate your understanding and support. Thank you for your interest in our project.


## Datasets and Results
The framework has been extensively validated on publicly available diabetic retinopathy grading datasets, such as EyePACS and Messidor. Detailed results and comparative analyses are provided to illustrate the advancements achieved by our model.(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/diabetic-retinopathy-detection, https://www.adcis.net/en/third-party/messidor/)
